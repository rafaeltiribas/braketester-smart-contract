# braketester-smart-contract

We adopt [Hyperledger Fabric 2.2 LTS](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/) as our blockchain platform. We configure a globally distributed blockchain network that supports the execution of Golang chaincodes.

## The customized blockchain network

If you are not used to the Hyperledger Fabric, we strongly recommend this [tutorial](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/test_network.html). It teaches in detail how to create a test Fabric network.

### 1. Prepare the host machine.

You need to install the **Hyperledger Fabric 2.2 LTS** basic software and [dependencies](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html). We try to make things simpler by providing a shell script that installs all these stuff in a clean **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** system. If you are using this distribution, our script works for you. If you have a different distribution, you can still try the script or customize it to work in your system.

Execute the **installation script**, localizated in prerequirements folder, in both host.

```console
./prerequirements/installFabric.sh
```

**OBSERVATION**: You do not need to run the script as *sudo*. The script will automatically ask for your *sudo* password when necessary. That is important to keep the docker containers running with your working user account. You will need to reboot your machine after execute this script.

### 2. Generate the MSP artifacts

The MSP artifacts include all the cryptographic stuff necessary to identify the peers of a Fabric network. They are basically asymmetric cryptographic key pairs and self-signed digital certificates. Currently, we are working on security policy to generate and distribute the MSP artifacts among organizations. As a workaround, only one organization must execute this procedure and replicate the MSP artifacts for the others. 

Execute the script to generate MSP artifacts in one host and copy to the other:

```console
./start.sh generateMSP
```

This script uses **configtx.yaml** and **crypto-config-nmi.yaml** to create the MSP certificates in the folder **crypto-config**. It also generates the genesis block file *genesis.block*. Notice that this script depends on the tools installed together with Fabric. The script *installFabric.sh* executed previously is expected to modify your $PATH variable and enable the Fabric tools' direct execution. If this does not happen, try to fix the $PATH manually. The tools usually are in the folder /$HOME/fabric-samples/bin.

### 3. Manage the docker containers

We use the **docker-compose** tool to manage the docker containers in our network. It reads the peer-*.yaml files and creates/starts/stops all the containers or a specific group of containers. You can find more details in the [Docker Compose Documents](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).


In both hosts, you must use the following command to start the network:

```console
./start.sh up
```

The same tool can be used to stop the containers, just if you need to stop the blockchain network for any reason. In a similar manner as done before, use the following command to stop all the containers:

```console
./start.sh down
```

### 4. Create the Fabric channel and join the peers

The next step consists of creating a channel (in practice, the ledger among the peers) and joining all the active peers on it. It is important to remember that we create a channel only once, in **host_aws**. Thus the first organization to start its peers *MUST* create the channel. The following organizations will only fetch for an existing channel and join on it. The script [start.sh](start.sh) implements both situations.

```console
./start.sh createChannel
```

If you succeed in coming so far, the Hyperledger Fabric shall be running in your server, with an instance of your organization network profile. You can see information from the containers by using the following commands:

```console
docker ps
docker stats
```

### 5. Deploy a chaincode

Chaincodes are smart contracts in Fabric. In this document, we assume you already know how to implement and deploy a chaincode. If it is not your case, there is a [nice tutorial](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/chaincode4ade.html) covering a lot of information about this issue. We strongly recommend you to check it before continuing.

A copy of the chaincode source is available [here](nesa/nesa.go).

Our blockchain network profiles include, for each organization, a client container *cli*, which effectively manages chaincodes. The *cli* is necessary to compile the chaincode and install it in an endorser peer. It is also handy to test chaincodes. It provides an interface to execute the command *peer chaincode*. 

By default, we associate *cli* with the *peer0* of the respective organization. You also can replicate its configuration to create additional client containers. We provide the script **start.sh** that encapsulates the use of a client container and simplifies the chaincode life cycle management. The script has the following syntax:

```console
./start.sh deployCC -ccn <chaincode name> -ccp <chaincode path> -ccl <chaincode language>
```

A example of this command is:

```console
./start.sh deployCC -ccn braketester -ccp braketester -ccl go
```

This command will do all you need to invoke the chaincode.

obs: Deploy first the chaincode in **host2_aws** and after in **host_aws**.

### 6. Test a chaincode

You can test the chaincode using this command.

```console
./start.sh testCC -c <channel-name> -ccn <chaincode name> -args <arguments>
```

## Dealing with client applications

The client application is a set of Python 3 modules that use the blockchain network's chaincode services.

You need to install some dependencies and libraries before getting the clients running correctly. We described all the steps necessary to prepare your machine to do that.

### Get pip3

Install the Python PIP3 using the following command:

```console
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

### Get the Fabric Python SDK

The [Fabric Python SDK](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-py) is not part of the Hyperledger Project. It is maintained by an independent community of users from Fabric. However, this SDK works fine, at least to the basic functionalities we need.

You need to install the Python SDK dependencies first:

```console
sudo apt-get install python-dev python3-dev libssl-dev
```

Now, install the Python SDK using *git*. Notice that the repository is cloned into the current path, so we recommend installing it in your $HOME directory. After cloning the repository, it is necessary to check out the tag associated with the version 1.0.

```console
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-py.git
cd fabric-sdk-py
git checkout tags/v1.0.0-beta
sudo make install
```

### Configure the .json network profile
The Python SDK applications depend on a network profile encoded in a .json format. Since we have two independent organizations, the network profile changes accordingly to them. In this repository, we provide the [inmetro.br.json](nesa-cli/inmetro.br.json) file. The network profile keeps the necessary credentials to access the blockchain network. You must configure this file properly every time that you create new digital certificates in the MSP:

* Open the respective .json in a text editor;
* Check for the entries called "tlsCACerts", "clientKey", "clientCert", "cert" and "private_key" on each organization. Notice that they point out to different files into the (./cripto-config) directory that corresponds to digital certificates and keys of each organization. The private key must correspond to the user who will submit the transactions (by default, we use Admin);
* Check the MSP file structure in your deployment and verify the correct name of the files that contain the certificates or keys;
* Modify the .json file with the correct name and path of each required file.

### The Client Application modules

The Client Application includes the following modules:

* [keygen-ecdsa.py](fabpki-cli/keygen-ecdsa.py): It is a simple Python script that generates a pair of ECDSA keys. These keys are necessary to run all the other modules.
* [register-ecdsa.py](fabpki-cli/register-ecdsa.py): It invokes the *registerMeter* chaincode, which appends a new meter digital asset into the ledger. You must provide the respective ECDSA public key.
* [verify-ecdsa.py](fabpki-cli/verify-ecdsa.py): It works as a client that verifies if a given digital signature corresponds to the meter's private key. The client must provide a piece of information and the respective digital signature. The client module will inform **True** for a legitimate signature and **False** in the opposite.
* [Insert Measurement](nesa-cli/InsertbMeasurement): The folder InsertMeasurement contains the clients responsible for collecting data from a path, convert in json format and calling chaincode methods to insert this data into the blockchain.
* [Query History](nesa-cli/countHistory.py): Count all transactions present in the ledger for an id.
* [Get Consumption](nesa-cli/getConsumption.py): Get the data of a meter id.
* [Mongo](nesa-cli/mongo.py): A client to acess directly the database of the blockchain.
* [App](nesa-cli/app.py): An interface to acess the clients using your browser.

## Using the Hyperledger Explorer

The [Hyperledger Explorer](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/explorer) is a web tool that helps to monitor the blockchain network with a friendly interface. Our repository includes the extensions to use Explorer together with our experiment. We take the Explorer container-based distribution, that consists of two Docker images:
* **explorer**: a web server that delivers the application.
* **explorer-db**: a PostgreSQL database server that is required to run Explorer.

The following steps describe how to start and stop Explorer. Firstly, make sure that the blockchain network is up and that you executed the previous steps related to install and instantiate the *braketester* chaincode. You can check these points with the following command:

```console
docker ps
```
The Explorer is also a blockchain client. Before continuing, you must fix the Explorer connection profile, just like you did previously to the Python client. Again, we have this configuration in the [inmetro.br.json](explorer/inmetro.br.json) file. Notice that this file are very similar to our Python client connection profile. The procedure to fix them is also the same, with the difference that the Explorer **must** use the Admin credentials. Find the entries called "tlsCACerts", "clientKey", "clientCert", "signedCert" and "adminPrivateKey" of each organization. Replace them with the respective filenames in your MSP configuration, when necessary. **Do not change the files path** because it already points to the container's internal path that the Explorer knows (i.e., the path "/tmp/crypto" maps your local "./crypto-config" folder). Finally, edit the file [config.json](explorer/config.json) to point out for your organization connection profile (PTB or Inmetro).

Now, access the [explorer](explorer) folder and start the Hyperledger Explorer containers.
```console
cd explorer
docker-compose -f explorer-inmetro.yaml up -d
```

The first execution will pulldown the Docker images, and also create the PostgresSQL database. These procedures can require some time to execute. Wait 30 seconds and open the following local address in a web browser: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You must see the Hyperledger Explorer login screen.

* **login**: exploreradmin
* **password**: exploreradminpw

If you need to stop or shut down the Hyperledger Explore, proceed with the respective *docker-compose* commands, using *stop* to suspend the container's execution and *down* to remove the containers' instances. Here is an example:
```console
docker-compose -f explorer-ptb.yaml down
```

Eventually, you will need to remove the database volumes associated with the Hyperledger Explorer physically. You can do that by executing the following commands:
```console
docker volume prune
docker volume rm explorer_pgdata explorer_walletstore
```

### Issues

If you have any problem trying to bring up the network, creating the channel or deploying the chaincode, execute this steps:

First, bring down the network using the following command:

```console
./start.sh down
```

Now, use this to remove all volumes:

```console
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls)
```

This will solve most of your problems, so you can bring up the network again without any error. If that doesn't work, try praying. xD
